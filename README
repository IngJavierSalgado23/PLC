This repository was developed as a school project for the class of PLC Design 2016-1 by Antonio Salgado, Enrique Parra and Raul Gonzalez.
The idea of this project is to create an affordable PLC for education with all the function an expensive PLC contains.
Is build upon a Raspberry Py 3 processor and uses cheap electronics components (see schematics). 
The ladder logic interface is build using python 3, and provides the next functionality:

*Input (3) and Outputs (3)
*Normally closed and normally open inputs and outputs.
*Internal bit registers (100,000)
*Latch and unlatch
*Counters
*Timers
*Adding multiple substeps.
*Save and Load your ladder programs. (We use pickle to store the data, not compatible with other PLC software yet)
*Dynamic interface 

Upcoming features
*SSH connectivity.
*AWS IoT support for web applications.
*Save and load files compatability with other PLCs.
*Refactor Code.

Things to do
*Upload all the remaining source code, including resources (images and code examples).
*Upload schematics.
